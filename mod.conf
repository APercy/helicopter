description = It adds an expensive helicopter and with power consumption. It uses power blocks to fly. With power blocks on your inventory, you can recharge your helicopter attaching himself into it (with right click on seat) and punching the seat after. It does not refuel on flying, only when landed. The power consumption increases as high you climb, so, stay below the flight level 100.
